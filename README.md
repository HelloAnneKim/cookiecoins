Charity CryptoCurrency - Decentralized Bakesale

##Rationale

Today, non-governmental organizations rely heavily on fundraising for financial support. We seek to use decentralized blockchain technologies to help them raise more money and do it in a secure and transparent way.

###Traditional Fundraising Strategy

One traditional fundraising activity is a bake sale. In this example, a charity hosts an event during which volunteers offer a cookie (or similar) in exchange for monetary donations. This is an one-time event during which donors make contributions directly to the charity or to the volunteer who then immediately passes it to the charity. In other words, the donor makes one-time primary transactions to support the charity and receives a cookie in return.

###Secondary Transactions

**What if there was a network for secondary (or higher degree) transactions for charitable donations?**
